# Kits

One row per kit. Fill the blanks. Values in *italics* came from
`machines/*.scd` or `utils/network/README.md`. Correct them if they're wrong.

When an AP address here differs from `apAddr` in that kit's machine file,
**the machine file has to change too**. The app identifies itself by that
address at boot, and provisioning reads it from there.

## Network

| Kit | Label | User | SSID | AP IP (want) | Radio | Stick IPs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| airkit1 | *AirKit1* | *MiM* | AirKit1_Network | *192.168.100.1* | internal | |
| airkit2 | *AirKit2* | *Mel* | AirKit2_Network | *192.168.200.1* | *USB dongle (Techkey RTL88x2BU?)* | |
| airkit3 | *AirKit3* | *Alon* | AirKit3_Network | *192.168.150.1* | internal | |
| airkit4 | *AirKit4* | *Nic* | AirKit4Network | *192.168.50.1* | internal | |
| airkit5 | AirKit5 | *SensiLab* | AirKit5Network | *192.168.250.1* | internal | |
| development | *AirKitDevelopment* | *Steph* | AirKitDevelopment | *192.168.70.1* | internal | |

- **Passphrases are not recorded here.** You keep them in
  `ansible/vault.yml`, encrypted with `ansible-vault`. Provisioning decrypts
  them at run time and never logs them.
- **Stick IPs:** the sticks have static IPs baked into their firmware, so they
  must sit inside the AP's subnet. If an AP IP changes subnet, the sticks need
  reflashing. Give the range, e.g. `.40–.48`.
- **Radio:** `internal`, or the USB dongle model. A dongle kit also gets the
  internal Wi-Fi disabled, as airkit2 has now.

## Hardware

| Kit | Pi eth0 MAC | Pi wlan0 MAC | Dongle MAC | Audio interface | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| airkit1 | *d8:3a:dd:ca:e3:d4?* | *d8:3a:dd:ca:e3:d5?* | | | |
| airkit2 | *d8:3a:dd:ca:e3:3e?* | *d8:3a:dd:ca:e3:3f?* | | | |
| airkit3 | | | | | |
| airkit4 | | | | | |
| development | | | | | |

The MACs come from `macs:` in the machine files, which doesn't say which is
eth0 and which is wlan0. Provisioning reports each card's real MACs in
`reports/`, so these can be left blank and filled from the first round.

**Audio interface:** `start_airkit.sh` runs `amixer -c 2 set Speaker 90%`, so
each kit expects a sound card at index 2 with a `Speaker` control. Which device
is it, and is it the same on every kit?
